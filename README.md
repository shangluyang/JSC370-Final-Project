# Bike Share Analysis

Bike sharing system is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals, recently bike-sharing companies have become one of the hottest tech companies in the world especially in china, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world. In this project, we will use data generated from a bike-sharing app in the Washington D.C, these apps generate a large amount of data on a daily basis and are important for studying the customer travel demand and their local road system. We aim to make deep analysis to investigate which factors contributing to bike rental demand.

The data is retrieved from Kaggle, a famous data competition platform. You could observe the data from the following url: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data. Each row records relevant information within a hour period. The data is pretty clear, it does not contain any missing value.
